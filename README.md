# Modelling and Forecasting of Temperature (monthly) Time Series Data

Time series modelling and forecasting â€“ a method that predicts future values by analysing past values plays an important role in many practical fields.The
forecasting of temperature on a seasonal time scale has been attempted by many researchers by different techniques at different times across the globe. It is a
challenging task to forecast temperature on a monthly and seasonal time scale.

This project presents a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to long term temperature data of India for the period of 117 years (1901-2017).
